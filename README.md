# SDL-1945
![](assets/ui/Title.png) </br>
Top-down scroller game made to test the creation of a personal 2D engine with C(programming language), SDL2(library) and CMake(compiler). </br>
The game is a remake of the old videogame "<b> 1945: The Final Front </b>"(upper image). Although the game is not complete and it has some soft bugs, it works properly :) </br>
<h2>Commands</h2>
<b>Movement:</b> WASD buttons </br>
<b>Shoot:</b> SpaceBar button
